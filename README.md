## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/filmfinder.git
    ```
    
2.  **Install dependencies for both frontend and backend:**
    
    ```
    # Frontend
    npm install
    
    # Backend
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    

## Configuration

### Backend

1.  **Set up your MySQL database:**
    
    -   Create a new database named `filmfinder`.
        
    -   Import the provided SQL dump or set up the database tables as specified in the backend task sheet.
        
2.  **Configure environment variables:**
    
    -   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` folder with the following variables:
        
        env
        
        ```
        DB_HOST=your_database_host
        DB_USER=your_database_user
        DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
        DB_NAME=filmfinder
        JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
        
        ```
        
3.  **Start the backend server:**
    
    
    ```
    node ./bin/www
    ```

4. **Backend Self-Signed Key:**

    The backend uses a generic self-signed key for SSL. If you wish to use your own SSL certificates, replace the default key and certificate files located in the backend directory.
    

### Frontend

1.  **Update the API URL:**
    
    -   In your frontend code (e.g., in `src/utils/api.js`), update the API URLs to point to your backend server. For example:
        

        
        ```
        const API_URL = process.env.REACT_APP_API_URL || 'http://localhost:3000';
        ```
        
    -   Replace `'http://localhost:3000'` with your backend server's URL if it's deployed remotely.
        
2.  **Start the frontend server:**
    
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    

## Usage

1.  **Register or log in to your account.**
    
2.  **Search for movies by title and/or release year.**
    
3.  **View detailed information about each movie.**
    
4.  **Enjoy infinite scrolling through the movie list.**
    

## Deployment

### Backend Deployment on Azure VM

1.  **Set up the Azure VM:**
    
    -   Install Node.js and MySQL on the VM.
        
    -   Clone the repository and navigate to the backend folder.
        
    -   Install dependencies and set up the environment variables as described in the configuration section.
        
2.  **Configure Firewall and Ports:**
    
    -   Open the necessary ports (e.g., port 3000) in the Azure VM's network security group to allow incoming traffic.
        
3.  **Start the backend server using a process manager (e.g., PM2):**
    

    ```
    npm install -g pm2
    pm2 start ./bin/www
    ```
    

### Frontend Deployment

1.  **Build the frontend for production:**
   
    
    ```
    npm run build
    ```
    
2.  **Deploy the** `build` **folder to a static hosting service:**
    
    -   Use services like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
        
    -   Follow the specific instructions provided by the hosting service.
